The speaker was right to say this was ``not the election we expected.''His supporters said Gingrich had the votes to win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted by secret ballot.Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes.``He won't do it 'til he has his ducks in a row, and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party.
