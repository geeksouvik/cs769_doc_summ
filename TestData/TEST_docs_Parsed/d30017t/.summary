Swedlund said that after three years in the country, the international Red Cross, which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems.In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study.``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said.Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director.
